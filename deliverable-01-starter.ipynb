    "### **Question 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A patient asks why a chest X-ray is \"safe\" but they worry about radiation exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the concepts above, answer:\n",
    "- (a) Why is a chest X-ray classified as ionizing radiation? What does \"ionizing\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Ionizing radiation is any form of radiation which has the ability (either directly or indirectly) to remove a bound electron from its shell in an atom. There are two subtypes of ionizing radiation:\n",
    "    - Directly ionizing radiation, which generally consists of fast-moving charged particles (e.g. electrons) which interact with bound electrons via Coulomb forces, thus transferring some of their kinetic energy to the bound electrons. If this kinetic energy transfer is larger than the binding energy of the bound electron, then the bound electron will be ionized.\n",
    "    - Indirectly ionizing radiation, which generally consists of non-charged particles (e.g. photons or neutrons) which have enough energy to free a charged particle. For instance, a photon with an energy higher than the binding energy of a bound electron could strike one such electron, freeing it via the photoelectric effect, or a neutron could strike a nucleus with enough kinetic energy to free a proton. This free charged particle can then directly ionize other charged particles.\n",
    "    The ionization potential of water is 12.6 eV; i.e. a photon must have at least 12.6 eV of energy to free a bound electron from a molecule of water, indirectly ionizing it. The human body is mostly water, so it is reasonable to assume a similar ionization potential (12 - 15 eV) for the molecules of the human chest. X-rays at diagnostic energies have energies ranging from 20 to 140 keV, which is significantly greater than the ionization potential of water, so there is a very high chance of indirect ionization occuring within the human body in a tyoical chest X-ray.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (b) A chest X-ray delivers ~0.1 mSv. A CT scan delivers ~7 mSv (70× higher). What does this mean for radiation dose to the patient?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    One sievert (Sv) of radiation is the SI measure of 'effective dose', or a measure of the amount of detrimental radiation applied to a given area of the body, as a factor of the actual dose applied, the biological effectiveness of the type of radiation, and the part of the body to which it is applied. Thus, more sieverts of effective dose result in higher risk of detrimental effects such as cancers or damage to DNA. Based on these provided values, we can see that a CT scan provides about 70x higher dosage of radiation compared to a chest X-ray. It should be noted that these values are still quite low; it is estimated that the average person receives an effective dose of about 3 mSv a year from natural sources; a chest X-ray is well below this value, and a CT scan is only slightly more than twice this value (i.e. the expected detrimental effects from the radiation of a CT scan are approximately equivalent to those from an average person just normally living for a little over 2 years)."

    "### **Question 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "An X-ray tube operates at 100 kVp with a tungsten target.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a) What is the maximum energy (in keV) of X-ray photons that can be produced?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The maximum energy of the produced X-ray photons is: $$E_{max} = eV_{peak} = (1 eV/V)(100 kVp)= 100 keV$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- b) Explain the difference between bremsstrahlung and characteristic X-rays. Which one produces the continuous spectrum and which produces discrete peaks?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bremsstrahlung occurs when a fast-moving electron interacts via Coulomb forces with an atomic nucleus, causing the electron to lose some of its kinetic energy. This energy is (partially, as bremsstrahlung's efficiency is generally very small; the rest is lost as heat) emitted as an X-ray photon. Because the energy transfer comes from the kinetic energy of the electron, it can have any value in a continuous range, so it produces the continuous spectrum.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Characteristic X-rays are produced when an atom has an inner shell vacancy (e.g. because a fast-moving electron has collided with an inner-shell electron, ionizing that electron). An upper-shell electron jumps down to fill this vacancy, causing (some of the time; otherwise an Auger electron may be produced instead) an X-ray photon to be emitted with an energy equalling the difference between the binding energies of the two shells. Because there are a small, finite number of shells in a given atom, and each shell has a characteristic binding energy, the resulting photon energy can only be a discrete handful of values; thus, in the spectrum, characteristic X-rays produce the discrete peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- c) Why do we use filtration (typically aluminum) at the X-ray tube output? What effect does this have on the X-ray spectrum and patient dose?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Low-energy photons are not helpful when trying to produce an image via X-ray imaging, but they can still ionize tissue, as they are still well above the ionization potential of water. Attenuating these low-energy photons while allowing higher-energy photons to pass through will thus provide the same image quality at a somewhat lower dose to the patient; this is the point of filtration at the X-ray tube output. Because beam attenuation is dependent on cross-section, which itself is dependent on both material properties (e.g. shell binding energies) and photon energy (much higher attenuation at low energies), we can choose materials to provide maximum attenuation at unwanted frequencies and minimal attenuation at the frequencies we need for imaging.\n"

    "- a) At this energy, both photoelectric absorption and Compton scattering occur. Which interaction mechanism is more likely to dominate in bone tissue versus soft tissue, and why? (Hint: Consider the atomic number dependence)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Bone tissue contains significant proportions of calcium (Z = 20) and phosphorus (Z = 15), while the body's soft tissue is primarily carbon (Z = 6), oxygen (Z = 8), and nitrogen (Z = 7). The photoelectric effect's cross section for a given atom is proportional to the fourth power of Z, while the cross section of Compton scattering is proportional only to the first power of Z and is more dependent on electron density than on atomic number. Thus, the photoelectric effect dominates overwhelmingly in bone tissue, while the proportions are somewhat more even in soft tissue.\n",
    "\n",
    "- b)Explain why Compton scattered photons are problematic for image quality. What specific image quality metric do they degrade?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Compton-scattered photons which reach the detector do so at effectively random locations due to the scattering, compared to the incident radiation. Thus, when we are attempting to locate regions which absorb more electrons, the scattered photons may trigger the detector at a location where photons were in fact being absorbed. This decreases the contrast of the resulting image and makes it more difficult to tell each region apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "- c) X-ray imaging systems use anti-scatter grids to reduce the detection of scattered photons. If a grid removes 80% of scattered photons but also blocks 20% of primary (unscattered) photons, when would you choose to use the grid versus imaging without it? Consider both image quality and patient dose.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This grid blocks the vast majority of scattered photons, which would improve the image contrast (by darkening areas that should be dark); however, it also blocks a fairly large proportion of primary photons, which will decrease the image contrast (by darkening areas that should be bright). Overall, more scattered photons than primary photons are removed, so the contrast should improve; however, a consequence of losing the primary photons is that a higher dose must be provided to the patient to get the same effectiveness. (In fact, this higher dose must be 25% higher than the original dose to obtain the same intensity of primary photons, because 1/0.8 = 1.25.) Thus, if our concern is primarily avoiding larger doses, then the grid must not be used; but if this is a less important consideration than improving the image quality, then the grid should be used. \n",
    "\n",
    "- d) In CT imaging, we use higher energies (120-140 keV) compared to conventional radiography (60-80 keV). Based on the energy dependence of photoelectric and Compton interactions, how does this affect the contrast between bone and soft tissue in CT images?\n",
    "\n",
    "    The probability of photoelectric interactions decreases significantly as photon energy increases, while the probability of Compton interactions increases to a peak and then begins to trail off. Good contrast between bone and soft tissue is seen due to photoelectric interactions, while Compton interactions provide poor contrast due to their weak Z dependance and their scattering angles; thus, we would expect to see poor contrast between bone and soft tissue in CT images."

The reason for this is that the attenuation coefficient is proportional to the sum of the cross-sections of each of the possible absorption or scattering effects that can occur at a given energy; at these higher energies, the total cross section is smaller because of the steep decline in interactions via the photoelectric effect. Though other effects have increased cross-sections at this energy, they are not enough to counteract that decline, and so the attenuation coefficient still decreases overall."

    "\n",
    "   No, we cannot reliably detect 100 μm objects with this detector, because they are smaller than the FWHM of the system. Based on the rule of thumb, the distance between the two edges of the object must be at least equal to the FWHM for it to be detected; thus, two microcalcifications could easily be detected as a single one, or one might be missed because the system resolution is large enough that the PSF would blur it too much.\n",

    "- b) You have two detector options:\n",
    "   - **Detector A**: 50 μm pixels, FWHM = 100 μm, readout time = 5 seconds\n",

    "   Which detector would you choose for mammography and why? Consider resolution requirements, patient motion, and clinical workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "   I would choose Detector A because of its better resolution (smaller FWHM means that the PSF is less blurred). We need to detect objects of 100 μm, so we need an FWHM that is at most 100 μm (based on the rule of thumb). There are two trade-offs, however; the patient must hold still for 5 seconds rather than one second (which is feasible, but will likely introduce some anatomical noise in the image, requiring potentially higher doses or contrast stretching), and this also means that fewer patients can be processed in a given period of time (but other steps in the clinical workflow introduce much more delay than this).\n",

    "- c) In PET imaging, using smaller detector crystals improves spatial resolution but also increases system cost and complexity. If you could reduce FWHM from 5 mm to 2.5 mm (2× improvement) at a 3× increase in cost, what clinical applications would justify this investment? Name at least two specific imaging tasks where the improved resolution would significantly impact diagnosis.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The investment in improving this system's FWHM would be justified if there were clinically important objects that could be detected using the higher-resolution system, but not using the lower-resolution system. As an example, the 5-mm FWHM system would be completely unable to detect lung nodules of 3-4mm, as well as calcifications of less than 5mm in size; the 2.5-mm FWHM system would easily detect the lung nodules and additional calficiations (though still not all possible micro-calcifications). This could impact the diagnosis of breast cancer from a mammography."
